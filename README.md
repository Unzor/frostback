# Frostback
A tool that imitates NPM, but with a small change: it works for the browser.

# Usage
Using Frostback is as simple as one-two-three. Just bundle any module:
```
$ frostback chalk
```
Then add this to your HTML code:
```html
<script src="frostback/chalk"></script>
```
And start your webserver!
